If we have file in local and want to push in remote repo
=========================================================

1)git status

2)git init  ->If your local directory is not already a Git repository, initialize it:

3)git remote add origin <remote-repo- Url> ->If you havenâ€™t added the remote repository yet, you need to do so. Replace <remote-repo-url> 
                                             with the URL of your remote repository:
											 
4)git remote -v ->You can check if the remote is set up correctly by running

5)git add <your-file> ->If you haven't added the file to the staging area yet, do so

6)git commit -m "Add <your-file> with initial content"

7)git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories ->Since the remote repository already has a main branch, you need to ensure that your
                                                     local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch.
                                                     Use the --allow-unrelated-histories flag if the histories are unrelated
													 
8)git commit ->

9)git push -u origin main
